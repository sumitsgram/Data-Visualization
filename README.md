# Interactive Data Visualization Dashboard

## Problem Statement
Imagine you are working on a project to build a product analytics platform for your company. The platform provides users with real-time data on sales, user engagement, etc. Your task is to develop a front-end application that includes interactive data visualization charts, advanced filtering options, and efficient cookie management for user preferences.

Additionally, the user will be sharing a view of the page with specific filters enabled and dates selected through the browser URL. Other users can then access the shared view by simply visiting this URL upon authentication.

## Requirements

### Interactive Data Visualization
- **Bar Chart**: Build a bar chart to represent the Features. A, B, C... are features and the x-axis is the total time spent between the selected date range.
- **Line Chart**: Implement a line chart to display the time trend of a particular category upon clicking in the bar chart. The chart should have pan, zoom-in, and zoom-out options on the time range.

### Advanced Filtering
- **Filters**: Include 2 filters:
  - Age (15-25, >25)
  - Gender (male, female)
- **Date Range Selector**: Add a date range selector component that allows users to choose a specific time range for analytics data. Update the graph based on the selected time range and filters.
